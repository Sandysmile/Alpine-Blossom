### 3.6 Summarized Coupon Attributes and Temperature related variables Analysis

Insights:
1)	Coupon Offer Distribution: Coffee House coupons were the most frequently offered, followed by budget restaurants, carryout options, bars, and upscale restaurants.
   
2)	Coupon Acceptance Rates: Carryout coupons emerged as the most accepted coupon type, with budget restaurants also showing high acceptance. In contrast, coffee houses (the most frequently offered), upscale restaurants, and bars had notably lower acceptance rates, averaging in the 0.4 range. This indicates a clear preference among drivers for conducting coupons over others.
     
3)	Expiration and Timing Preferences: Drivers prefer coupons with a one-day expiration, valuing the flexibility to plan over the immediacy of two-hour offers. Additionally, it suggests a need to align coupon offers with drivers' lifestyles and schedules for more effective promotion strategies for all coupon types.
   
4)	Environmental Influences: The analysis, primarily conducted on sunny days across three temperature ranges, reveals a positive correlation between coupon acceptance and comfortable, sunny weather conditions. This finding suggests that favorable environmental conditions play a role in increasing coupon engagement, pointing towards the importance of considering weather factors in coupon distribution plans.

Analytics Actions:

1)	Focused on 'Bar' and 'Carryout' coupons, identifying them respectively as the least and most popular among drivers for in-depth analysis.
  
2)	Expiration Attribute/Temperature Exclusion: Opted to remove expiration time from in-depth analysis due to its uniform application across coupon types across coupon types.
 
3)	Coupon Timing: Identified coupon timing as a critical variable for further analysis, especially for 'CarryOut' coupons, to align promotional efforts with drivers' preferences and routines.
    
4)	Weather Variable Exclusion: This decision acknowledges the dataset's sunny condition bias, aiming for a more representative understanding of factors driving coupon acceptance without the skewed influence of incomplete weather data.

![image](https://github.com/Sandysmile/Alpine-Blossom/assets/20648423/3f6a5cc8-bad9-41d7-9439-a70df0014669)

### 4.9 Major Insights/Hypothesis/Variables Identification

Bar Visit Frequency, Age, Passenger Presence, Income as critical determinants in coupon acceptance, alongside other significant factors such as Occupation, Marital Status, and Dining Preferences at budget-friendly restaurants.

1)	Drivers who visit bars Often (>3 visits) accept Bar Coupons  
2)	This suggests that bar coupons promotional efforts targeting drivers who are regular bar-goers could be effective.  
3)	Older drivers (>26 years old) who are regular bar-goers (>1) tends to accept coupons, indicating that older demographics, particularly those who are frequent bar visitors, are responsive to bar coupon promotions.  
4)	Regular (>1 visit) bar-goers(driver) without Kids passenger and not employed in Farming, Fishing, or Forestry Occupations are responsive to bar coupons.  
5)	Regular (>1 visit) bar-goers (widowed drivers) without kid’s passengers are responsive to bar coupons.  
6)	Young (<30 years older) and regular bar-goers(drivers) are responsive to bar coupons. lifestyle and saving.  
7)	Low incomed(<50k) drivers who often eats at a restaurant with average expense less than $20 (>4 times a month) are receptive to bar coupons)  
8)	Regular bar-goers(drivers), particularly those without child passengers, who might dine often at inexpensive restaurants due to income limitations, may exhibit a pattern of behavior that makes them more receptive to accepting coupons.   
9)	Combination of factors: age, the absence of kid’s passengers, lower income, regular bar visits, or a preference for cheaper dining options—could interplay to influence their increased likelihood of coupon acceptance

### 4.10 Coupon Strategy and Actions for Consideration

1)	Bar Visit Frequency: Targeting regular bar-goers (>1 visits) emerges as a critical strategy. Target on frequent visitors for coupon promotions.
  
2)	Age Dynamics:
   a.	Older patrons (>26 years) with habitual bar attendance (>1 visit) exhibit a greater probability of coupon use, reflecting their responsiveness to savings and lifestyle habits.  
   b.	Younger clientele (<30 years), consistent bar visitors, demonstrate a strong inclination towards coupon acceptance, linking lifestyle choices and savings orientation.
  
3)	Influence of Passenger, Marital Status, and Occupation:
   Bar patrons visiting more than once, not accompanied by children, and outside the Farming, Fishing, or Forestry sectors show a higher propensity for coupon engagement.
  		
4)	Economic and Dining Behavior:  
    Lower-income individuals (<$50K) who regularly dine affordably (>4 times a month) display an increased openness to bar coupons, underscoring economic motivations behind coupon acceptance. Promote bar coupon in 
   budgeted restaurants (<20 $)
  
5)	Composite Factors:
   A blend of no child companions, modest income, frequent bar visits, or favoring budget dining correlates with a heightened coupon acceptance probability, indicating a multifaceted interplay of demographic, 
   situational, and behavioral influences.

## 5. Carryout Coupon Analysis

###5.1 Conceptual Framework

This analysis divides the factors influencing coupon acceptance into three primary categories: Demographics, Behavioral Factors, and Situational Factors. Each category encompasses various elements that could significantly impact the likelihood of coupon acceptance.

Demographics
1)	Age: Young adults and professionals may have a higher propensity to accept coupons, aligning with their dynamic lifestyles and conduct needs.  
2)	Occupation: Those in demanding or fast-paced careers could value carryout coupons more, seeing them as beneficial for their daily routines.  
3)	Income Level: Income may dictate coffee purchasing habits, influencing where individuals prefer to buy their coffee.  
4)	Marital Status: Marital status might affect coffee consumption habits, potentially influencing coupon acceptance.  
5)	Has Children: Parenthood could impact daily routines, including coffee consumption and coupon usage.  
6)	Education: Educational background might correlate with coffee preferences and the likelihood of using coupons.
   
Behavioral Factors

1)	Destination: The purpose of travel could affect the likelihood of coffee coupon acceptance.  
2)	visit bars, coffee houses or restaurants frequently.  
3)	Time of Coupon: Coupons offered during specific times, such as mornings or mid-week, may have higher acceptance rates, aligning with work commutes.
   
Situational Factors

1)	Passenger Presence: The company of passengers with kids or without could influence the decision to accept coffee coupons.  
2)	Location Proximity and Convenience: Proximity to carryout locations, especially for urban residents, could significantly increase coupon acceptance due to convenience.

### 5.2 Repeat Step from 4.1 to 4.4 to create a subset for carry-out coupons only, and check the data quality again, and compute average carryout coupon acceptance rate.
### 5.3. Create Correlations(heatmap) between Numerical Features and Coupon Acceptance

In this phase of the analysis, I focused on evaluating the correlations between various numerical features within our dataset and the propensity for coupon acceptance, identified by numerical values: one for acceptance and zero for rejection.

My investigation into these relationships did not cover any significant correlations between the examined numerical features and the likelihood of coupon acceptance. Given this outcome.
![image](https://github.com/Sandysmile/Alpine-Blossom/assets/20648423/b0d6bc7b-d5c7-4d81-a346-5231d9989160)

Analytic Actions:
1)	Omit all numerical variables from subsequent stages of our analysis, as they did not demonstrate a meaningful impact on the acceptance of coupons.  
2)	Further analysis should guide the selection of contributing features to compose a classification model to predicate coupon acceptance outcome.

### 5.4 Understand the Relationships between Categorical Variables and Coupon Acceptance

The goal is to identify contributing features for modelling.

The following data exploration step is to go through all object features in the dataset to see the relationships between the feature and coupon acceptance briefly.

### 5.5. List of Variables Selected for Further Analysis

Based on the visualization analysis above and bar coupon example, the following factors seem individually or in combination, to play a role in determining the likelihood of coupon redemption.

1) Demographics
•	Age:  
•	Occupation: Focuses on unemployed individuals, students, and professionals in computer & mathematics, and sales sectors.  
•	Income Level: Specifically targets drivers with an income of $50k or below.
  
2) Coupon Attributes: Coupon Timing: Indicates the importance of when the coupon is offered.

3) Situation Factors:
•	Destination: Reflects the impact of the driver's intended destination.  
•	Passenger Composition and Marital Status: Considers the presence of children as passengers and the marital status of the driver.
  
4) Behavior Factors:

•	Frequency of Carryout Orders: Emphasizes drivers who order carryout more than once.    
•	Bar Visit Frequency: Check the number of visits to bars as a potential factor.    
•	Dining at Restaurants with an Average Expense Under20: Accounts for drivers who frequently dine at more affordable restaurants.    
•	Visits to Mid-Range Restaurants ($20-$50): Limits the consideration to those visiting such restaurants less than three times.

### 5.6 Carryout Coupon Data Analysis Results and Hypothesis

#### 5.6.1 Age Has No or Minimal Impact on Carryout Coupon Acceptance

Analysis reveals that age does not significantly influence carryout coupon acceptance rates among different age groups. This observation is based on testing various age demographics, where the acceptance rates consistently hovered around the overall average.

It suggests that the propensity to utilize carryout coupons transcends age barriers, reflecting a lifestyle choice prevalent across all age cohorts. check out the sample analysis below.

#### 5.6.2 Occupation impacts carryout coupon acceptance.

Occupation plays a considerable role in the preference for carryout coupons, primarily due to varying work schedules. Individuals in certain professions, particularly those with demanding or strict schedules, show a higher inclination towards carryout options.

Conversely, groups such as students, tech professionals, and sales personnel, who often benefit from more flexible schedules, exhibit a lower propensity for carryout coupon usage. This pattern suggests that the acceptance of carryout coupons is linked to the demands and flexibility of one’s professional commitments.

#### 5.6.3 Income's Influence on Carryout Coupon Acceptance

Income levels significantly affect the likelihood of accepting carryout coupons. Individuals with lower incomes are more inclined to utilize carryout coupons compared to their higher-income counterparts. This trend underscores the importance of income as a determining factor in the adoption of carryout coupon usage.

#### 5.6.4 Income and Occupation are Key Demographics Determinants in Carryout Coupon Acceptance

Individuals with lower incomes or specific occupational backgrounds (not students and computer folks) exhibit a marked preference for carryout coupons, motivated by economic savings and convenience. This trend highlights how financial considerations and job nature synergistically influence the likelihood of embracing carryout options.

![image](https://github.com/Sandysmile/Alpine-Blossom/assets/20648423/2dd6cefb-9bc1-4523-8977-3138c3279724)

#### 5.6.5. Destination, Income, and Occupation Impact on Carryout Coupon Acceptance

Individuals with no immediate destination, coupled with lower income levels and occupations outside of student and computer/mathematical fields, are more likely to accept carryout coupons compared to the average. This trend suggests that the combination of having flexible travel plans, economic considerations, and specific job categories significantly influences the propensity to opt for carryout offerings.

The preference for carryout among these groups may reflect a strategic choice for convenience and cost-saving, particularly when there is no pressing need to be at a particular place.

#### 5.6.6 Passenger and Marital Status Influence on Carryout Coupon Acceptance

The decision to accept carryout coupons is notably affected by the presence of passengers and the individual's marital status. Specifically, those identified as 'Divorced' or 'Widowed' show a higher preference for carryout options. Conversely, drivers accompanied by child passengers tend to decline carryout coupon offers.

This behavior pattern might come from psychological factors where:
  1) Individuals may prefer solitude or avoid social interactions during certain life stages.
  2) Dining out with children is often viewed as a valuable social activity, offering quality time outside the home rather than opting for carryout.
     
These insights highlight the complex interplay between social circumstances and dining preferences, influencing coupon acceptance behavior.  

#### 5.6.7 Impact of Destination and Coupon Timing on Carryout Coupon Acceptance

Drivers/Professionals exhibit a preference for utilizing carryout options outside of work hours, driven by convenience.   
This trend underscores the considerable influence of both the intended destination and the timing of coupon offers on the acceptance of carryout coupons. The choice to opt for carryout during non-working hours suggests a strategic decision to maximize time efficiency and convenience in personal schedules.

![image](https://github.com/Sandysmile/Alpine-Blossom/assets/20648423/71481108-a544-4a09-93b3-d13f8c5f8709)


#### 5.6.8 Similar to Bar Coupon Analysis: Slightly Higher Coupon Acceptance Among Regular Carryout Drivers

The analysis reveals that drivers who frequently opt for carryout are more inclined to accept coupons. This trend suggests a correlation between regular carryout habits and a positive response to coupon offers, due to heightened receptivity to savings opportunities among these consumers.

#### 5.6.9 Carryout Coupon Usage Among Infrequent Coffee House Patrons
Infrequent visitors to coffee houses are more likely to utilize carryout coupons. This pattern may indicate that those who do not regularly frequent coffee establishments view carryout coupons as a compelling incentive to make a purchase, potentially due to perceived value or the opportunity to try something new with reduced financial risk.

#### 5.6.10 Bar Visitation Frequency Unrelated to Carry-Out Coupon Acceptance
The frequency of bar visits has no significant impact on coupon acceptance. This observation holds true whether an individual is a frequent bar patron or not, indicating that bar visitation habits do not necessarily correlate with the likelihood of utilizing carry-out coupons.

#### 5.8.11 No Correlation Between Restaurant Visit Frequency and Carryout Coupon Usage

The frequency of restaurant visits, whether to upscale or budget establishments, does not influence carryout coupon acceptance. This finding suggests that dining out habits, irrespective of the restaurant's price range, are not indicative of a customer's propensity to use carryout coupons.

### 5.9 Summary of Insights and Findings

Significant Factors:

 •	Occupation: Demanding jobs increase, while flexible schedules (students, tech, sales) decrease carryout coupon use.  
 •	Income Level: Lower-income individuals are more inclined towards carryout coupons for economic reasons.  
 •	Income & Occupation: A crucial combination affecting non-students and those outside tech, emphasizing savings and convenience.  
 •	Destination & Income: No urgent destination plus lower income and specific jobs suggest a cost-saving, convenient preference.
